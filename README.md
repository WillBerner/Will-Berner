# [Personal Portfolio](https://willberner.github.io/Will-Berner/)

My personal portfolio webpage. Created with React and styled via Bootstrap.

Displays a short bit of information about me, a few projects I've worked on, a form to contact me (currently nonfunctional), and a page with my resume and some of my skills. Please check it out if you're interested!
