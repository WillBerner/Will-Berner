                My name is Will and I'm a recent graduate of UNC Chapel Hill's Deptartment of Computer Science. I'm now taking a Coding Bootcamp to continue to learn new technologies and build my skill set! I love any sort of programming, but enjoy creating Javascript web-based projects the most.

                I'm a long time resident of the triangle area, specifically Chapel Hill. I got into computer science when I was still young in Middle School through building custom computers. I thought technology and computers were so important considering how much I used them daily so I thought I'd demystify the magic myself and learn how it all happens. I ended up acing my first programming course at UNC, was recruited to be an LA, and went on to help teach the course for the next five semesters.

                I'm now in the process of applying for full-time positions around the central NC area. When I don't have VSCode pulled up I'm out running, hiking or biking, watching soccer, or playing with my two year old dog, Sudo.
